 * a song's colour never changes, so one lookup a track is the ceiling.
 *
 * The THUMB, never the player-size cover. `artworkColor` on the native side is
 * a raw HttpURLConnection — a second, separate download of an image Fresco is
 * already fetching for the <Image> beside it, competing for the same link as
 * the audio stream trying to start. Palette samples the bitmap down to ~112px
 * before it looks at a single pixel, so the other 400 lines were being decoded
 * and thrown away. The 150x150 is also the exact URL every track row has
 * already pulled, so on a list it is usually free twice over.
 *
 * Everything degrades to `null` (plain dark background): an old APK without
 * the native method, a bad URL, an unreadable image — none of them may cost
 * more than the tint.

/**
 * The song's colour as a SURFACE colour — muted and dark, not merely darkened.
 *
 * `toward` scales the channels toward black and leaves saturation exactly where
 * it was, which is why a neon cover produced a neon bar. #00FF3C darkened by
 * half is #007A1E: lower in luminance, every bit as saturated, and against a
 * true-black UI a fully saturated hue reads far louder than its brightness
 * suggests. The mini player under a bright green album turned into a green slab
 * that belonged to no part of the app.
 *
 * Clamping SATURATION is what was missing. Hue is the part worth keeping — it
 * is what makes the bar feel like it belongs to the song — while saturation and
 * lightness are what decide whether it still reads as one of this app's dark
 * surfaces. Pinned rather than scaled, so the result is the same kind of
 * surface whether the cover is neon or nearly grey.
