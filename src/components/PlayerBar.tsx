/**
 * The mini player above the bottom nav.
 *
 * Shows where the sound is going when it isn't the phone speaker — a headphone
 * glyph plus the device name — because "why is nothing coming out of my phone"
 * is answered by that line alone.
 *
 * Swiping it left or right skips, matching the gesture on the full player's
 * artwork, so the same motion means the same thing in both places.
 *
 * ## What makes it read as a floating bar rather than a toolbar
 *
 * Four things, and they are all finishing rather than layout:
 *
 *   - It has ELEVATION. A background and a radius with no shadow sits flat
 *     against the page; a bar that floats has to look like it does.
 *   - The fill is a vertical GRADIENT, lighter at the top where the light is.
 *     One solid darkened colour is the flattest a surface can look.
 *   - The corners are CONCENTRIC: outer radius = inner radius + padding. Bar
 *     and artwork were both 8, which is what made it read as two rectangles
 *     that happen to overlap.
 *   - The three controls share ONE slot size and one optical weight. Play used
 *     to sit in a filled disc so it would dominate; at 38px the circle is
 *     heavier than the bar it lives on, and it made the three controls read as
 *     three different KINDS of control rather than one row.
