/**
 * The navigation drawer.
 *
 * Opens from the hamburger on Home, or by dragging in from anywhere in Home's
 * empty space. It holds the things that are *about* the app rather than about
 * the music — settings, shortcuts, your listening activity — so the bottom nav
 * stays purely about content and the Home header loses its stray gear.
 *
 * Driven by ONE Animated.Value, `drawerX`, which lives in ../drawer rather than
 * in this component. That is what lets the opening gesture drive the panel
 * directly: the finger writes to the same value the settle animation does, so
 * the panel tracks the drag from the first pixel instead of appearing after the
 * finger lifts. The scrim's opacity is an interpolation of that same value, so
 * the dim and the slide can never disagree mid-gesture.
 *
 * NOT a <Modal>, for the same reason nothing else in this app is: a Modal is its
 * own window, it cannot be dragged into view underneath an in-progress gesture,
 * and it floats over the mini player. As a plain absolute overlay it can be
 * half-open, which is the whole feature.
