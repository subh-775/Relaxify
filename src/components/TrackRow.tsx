   * Swipe right to queue — recognised NATIVELY, which is the whole point.

   * This was a PanResponder, and it lost a race it could not win. Its

   * the parent FlatList's scroller is a native Android ScrollView that claims
   * the touch on the UI thread — and once a native scroll view has claimed a
   * gesture, PanResponder cannot take it back. On a slow drag JS kept up and
   * won; on a fast flick the scroller had already locked the touch stream.
   *
   * The old `dx > 14 && |dx| > |dy| * 2` ratio made it worse. Touch events
   * arrive at a fixed rate, so a fast flick's FIRST move event already carries
   * a big delta — dx 40, dy 25 fails `40 > 50` — while a slow drag's first
   * event is dx 6, dy 1 and sails through. That is literally "I have to move my
   * finger slowly".
   *
   * activeOffsetX/failOffsetY replace the ratio entirely: gesture-handler
   * evaluates them natively against the raw touch stream, so a 40px-per-frame
   * flick activates on its first event. failOffsetY is what still protects
   * vertical scrolling.
