/**
 * The two-level "+" that replaced the ⊕ and the ♥ in both players.
 *
 * Not liked  → tap → liked, and the glyph fills. The common action, one press,
 *              no sheet in the way.
 * Liked      → tap → the "Saved in" sheet, for everything that is not Liked
 *              Songs.
 * Either     → long press → straight to the sheet, so wanting a playlist does
 *              not mean liking the song first and then unliking it.
 *
 * The glyph MUST change on the first press, or the second press reads as the
 * first one having failed — which is the way a control with two levels usually
 * goes wrong.
 *
 * One component rather than the same logic in the player and the mini player,
 * because two copies of a two-level control is two chances for them to end up
 * disagreeing about what the second press does.

 * + changed and the sheet did not, which is how a filled green disc with a
 * true-black ring ended up sitting next to the outline version in the same
 * screen. Two copies of one glyph is two chances for them to disagree, and the
 * disagreement is invisible until someone screenshots both at once.
 *
 * The shape is the same in both states: an outline at the same weight, no fill,
 * no contrasting rim. Only the colour and the mark inside the circle change.
 * The fill is what forced the dark ring in the first place — Lucide applies
 * `color` as the stroke to the circle AND the tick, so a green disc needed a
 * dark stroke to keep its tick legible, and that stroke ringed the disc too.
