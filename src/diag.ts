/**
 * A small in-app event log.
 *
 * There is no USB debugging in the loop for this project: builds are installed
 * from a release tag and tested by people who cannot run `adb logcat`. Without
 * something like this, "the equalizer does nothing" and "the update popup
 * sometimes doesn't appear" are unfalsifiable — the app has no way to say what
 * it tried and what came back.
 *
 * Deliberately tiny: a fixed ring buffer in memory, no persistence, no upload.
 * It costs nothing when nobody opens the Diagnostics screen.
 *
 * It ALSO mirrors to logcat now. USB debugging turned out to be possible after
 * all, and the first capture from a real session contained not one line from
 * our own code — because a release build installs no React Native console, so
 * every diag() call died in the buffer above. `adb logcat -s MPJS` shows them.
