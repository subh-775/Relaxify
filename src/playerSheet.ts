/**
 * The full player's position, shared — and the geometry that lets it become the
 * mini player rather than merely sliding past it.
 *
 * Same reasoning as `src/drawer.ts`, and the same shape: a Reanimated shared
 * value outside the component, so a gesture ANYWHERE can drive the panel frame
 * by frame on the UI thread rather than asking PlayerScreen to animate itself
 * once the finger has already let go. That is what lets a drag UP on the mini
 * player open the panel under the fingertip — the mini player and the panel are
 * different components, and a `useSharedValue` inside one is not reachable from
 * the other.
 *
 * ## The transition
 *
 * There is no shared-element library here and there does not need to be. Both
 * artworks are already on screen at once (PlayerScreen sits at zIndex 30 over a
 * mini player that is never unmounted), they show the SAME image at the same
 * moment, and the panel's own travel already moves the big one most of the way.
 * All that was missing is where the two squares actually are.
 *
 * So each side reports its own on-screen rect (`measureInWindow`), in the same
 * coordinate space, so the status bar and the navigation bar cancel out instead
 * of having to be guessed at. Nothing is hardcoded, so rotation, a font-scale
 * change or a relayout fixes itself on the next frame.
 *
 * ## State is a PROPORTION; measurements are only ever geometry
 *
 * This separation is the hard-won part, and every bug this file has had came
 * from blurring it. `sheetP` says how far along the transition is, 0 to 1, and
 * nothing measured can change it. Pixels — how far to slide, how much to
 * shrink, where to land — are derived from it and the current measurements,
 * fresh every frame.
 *
 * It used to be the other way round: the value held PIXELS, and progress was
 * `pixels / measuredSpan`. The closed position was therefore a pixel figure
 * snapshotted when the dismissal began, while the span kept being re-measured —
 * so anything that relaid the mini player out afterwards (a song change, a
 * Bluetooth device appearing in the bar) moved the finish line out from under a
 * value already parked. Progress settled at 0.93 rather than 1, the cover
 * stopped short of the slot, and a second artwork sat there off to one side.
 * Different measurement timings on different launches is precisely why it
 * behaved differently every time the app was opened.
