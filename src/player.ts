/**
 * Audio playback, on ExoPlayer via react-native-track-player.

 * Why a native engine rather than something JS-side: it plays in a real
 * foreground service, so audio survives the app being backgrounded, and it
 * publishes a MediaSession — which is what makes lock-screen controls and
 * Bluetooth/earbud buttons work properly. That was the whole reason for moving
 * off the WebView.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: the native side only exists in a build that included this library.
 * On an older APK the JS module still bundles but every native call throws, so
 * everything here is guarded and `isAvailable()` reports the truth instead of
 * the app crashing.
