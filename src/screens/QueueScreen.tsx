/**
 * What's playing and what's next. Tap a row to jump; drag the grip to reorder.
 *
 * Reads the engine's real queue rather than a copy held in JS, so it can't
 * drift from what will actually play.
 *
 * ## Why this uses Reanimated rather than PanResponder
 *
 * Three previous attempts at drag-to-reorder were built on PanResponder +
 * Animated, and every one of them was reported as laggy. The reason is
 * structural, not a tuning problem: with PanResponder the gesture is delivered
 * to the JS thread, so every frame of a drag competes with React renders, the
 * playback event handlers and the backend fetches this app is doing constantly.
 * Under load the JS thread simply cannot keep 60fps, and the row visibly trails
 * the finger no matter how the maths is arranged.
 *
 * react-native-gesture-handler + Reanimated run the gesture and the row
 * transforms on the UI thread as worklets. JS is not in the frame loop at all,
 * so a busy JS thread cannot make the drag stutter. That is the whole reason
 * for the dependency, and it is why this one should actually feel right.
 *
 * ## Only upcoming tracks reorder
 *
 * The playing track is pinned above the list and cannot be dragged, and nothing
 * can be dropped above it. RNTP's remove() maps to ExoPlayer's removeMediaItem,
 * and removing the item that is currently playing stops playback — a queue
 * where the active row was draggable could kill the music mid-drag. This also
 * matches the reference build, whose queue is upcoming-only.
