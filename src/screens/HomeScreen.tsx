  /**
   * Drag right near the left edge to pull the drawer in, with the panel
   * following the finger the whole way — Gmail / Twitter / ChatGPT behaviour.
   *
   * Recognised NATIVELY. As a PanResponder this lost the same race TrackRow's
   * swipe did: the JS predicate ran after the native scroller had already
   * claimed a fast flick, and its `dx > |dy| * 2` ratio failed on the large
   * first delta a fast flick delivers. activeOffsetX/failOffsetY are evaluated
   * on the raw touch stream, so speed stops mattering.
   *
   * ## Why this is attached to the whole screen and not to a strip
   *
   * The previous design put the pan on a transparent 28dp `View` pinned to the
   * left edge, with `pointerEvents="box-only"`. That view took every touch in
   * the band and passed none of them on, so a vertical scroll starting there
   * failed `failOffsetY` and then went nowhere — the list underneath never saw
   * it. That is the "the page won't scroll near the left edge" report.
   *
   * The pan now lives on the screen itself and is armed at the edge by
   * `hitSlop`, which does the same job in the one place where it costs nothing:
   * `{left: 0, width: DRAWER_EDGE}` makes RNGH's `isWithinBounds` treat the
   * handler's activation area as the left DRAWER_EDGE pixels of the view and
   * nothing else (GestureHandler.kt: `right = left + width`). Touches outside
   * the band never reach this handler; touches INSIDE it reach the list too,
   * because there is no longer a view in the way.
   *
   * `failOffsetY` is 6, not 14. While the pan is BEGAN the scroller cannot
   * start, so that number is literally how many pixels of every vertical drag
   * in the band get swallowed before the list gets its touch.
   *
   * One gesture at a time. The list is wrapped as `Gesture.Native()` so RNGH
   * can arbitrate between the two: whichever activates first wins and the
   * other is cancelled. A sideways pull owns the finger until it lets go (the
   * page no longer scrolls under the opening drawer), and a scroll that has
   * started never turns into a drawer. The two used to be declared
   * simultaneous, which is what let one drag do both.
   *
   * The drawer is told it is opening on ACTIVATION (`onStart`), not on
   * touch-down. A touch in the band that becomes a scroll fails this pan and
   * never reaches `onEnd`, so a touch-down `begin` left the (closed) drawer
   * marked open, taking the back button and touches meant for the page.
