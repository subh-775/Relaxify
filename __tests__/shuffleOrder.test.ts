/**
 * Shuffle off must RESTORE, not reshuffle.
 *
 * The report was "each time shuffle is turned on or off, the songs are
 * randomized", and both halves of that were one bug. Turning shuffle on
 * snapshots the upcoming tracks so that turning it off can put them back — but
 * the queue keeps moving in between. Songs play and leave the upcoming list,
 * radio appends more, a swipe skips two at once. Re-adding the snapshot whole
 * put back songs that had already been heard and dropped ones added since, so
 * OFF produced an order every bit as arbitrary as ON. Neither direction ever
 * restored anything, which is why it read as a button that did not work.
 *
 * The rule is one sentence: keep the ORDER from the snapshot, keep the
 * MEMBERSHIP from the live queue.
