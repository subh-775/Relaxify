/**
 * playTrack now starts the song on a ONE-track queue and fills the rest in
 * behind it, so the wait to hear something no longer scales with the length of
 * the playlist you tapped from.
 *
 * That reordering is the one change in this release that could put the wrong
 * song on: if the appends and the prepend land in the wrong order, "next" plays
 * something you never chose. This drives the real playTrack against a fake
 * engine and asserts the queue it ends up with is the list, in order, with the
 * tapped track active.
