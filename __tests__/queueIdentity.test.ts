/**
 * Two bugs that produced one screenshot: a queue with five copies of the same
 * song in it, rows lifting in groups when one was dragged, and a track dropped
 * second playing much later.
 *
 * 1. Every queue item carried `id: title-artist`, so duplicates of a song were
 *    indistinguishable to the list. DraggableFlatList tracks the lifted cell BY
 *    KEY and VirtualizedList registers cells by key, so duplicate keys collapse
 *    rows together and hand back the wrong drop index.
 * 2. topUpFromRadio claimed its re-entrancy flag AFTER an await, so the track
 *    change event and the crossfade watcher could both pass the guard and both
 *    append a batch of radio picks — deduped against the same pre-append
 *    snapshot, which is how the duplicates got there in the first place.
