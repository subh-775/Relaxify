/**
 * The mini-player transition: the big cover has to land EXACTLY on the small
 * one, and the panel's surface has to land exactly on the bar's rectangle.
 *
 * This is geometry, so it either lines up or it does not — and the failure is
 * never a crash. It is a cover that stops a little short of the slot and sits
 * there as a second artwork off to one side, which is what shipped twice.
 *
 * ## Why `p` is a proportion
 *
 * The state used to be PIXELS, with progress worked out as `pixels / span`. The
 * closed position was therefore a pixel figure snapshotted when the dismissal
 * began, while the span kept being re-measured — so anything that relaid the
 * mini player out afterwards (a song change, a Bluetooth device appearing in
 * the bar) moved the finish line out from under a value already parked.
 * Progress settled at 0.93 instead of 1 and the cover stopped short.
 *
 * Every case below drives the transition by proportion, and the last group
 * pins the property that makes that class of bug impossible: the end state
 * does not depend on the measurements at all.
