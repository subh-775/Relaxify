# Add any project specific keep options here:

# ── Reflection surface: the equalizer, the loudness enhancer and the volume
# fade all reach ExoPlayer through RNTP/KotlinAudio privates, BY NAME. Anything
# R8 renames, removes or inlines here fails only at runtime, only in release,
# and only as "the effect silently does nothing" — so these are kept whole
# rather than surgically. The classes are small; the debugging cost is not.

# ExoPlayer / media3 itself: keep the player types and their members intact so
# getAudioSessionId / setVolume / getVolume still resolve reflectively, and so
# the optimizer cannot merge the class hierarchy the field walk relies on.

# AudioModule drives the player's volume by reflection (the background-safe

# up BY NAME on the ExoPlayer instance, so R8 must not rename or strip them, or
# every fade silently no-ops in release only.
