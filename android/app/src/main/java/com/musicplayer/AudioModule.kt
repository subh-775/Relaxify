/**
 * Audio effects and output routing.
 *
 * The WebView build shaped sound with eight Web Audio BiquadFilters. There is
 * no <audio> element here — ExoPlayer owns the stream — so the equivalent is
 * Android's own [Equalizer], and volume normalization becomes
 * [LoudnessEnhancer] rather than a DynamicsCompressor.
 *
 * ## Bands are the DEVICE's, not ours
 *
 * Android does not let an app choose band frequencies. Most phones expose five
 * bands at their own centre frequencies; some expose ten, and the valid gain
 * range differs too. So the 8-band curve the UI shows is INTERPOLATED onto
 * whatever this device actually has, at runtime, and clamped to its real range.
 * Nothing here is tuned for one handset.

    // ─── Crossfade: a SECOND player for the overlap, scheduled HERE ──────────
    //
    // react-native-track-player runs one ExoPlayer → one output, so a real
    // crossfade needs a second stream: a plain MediaPlayer (no new dependency,
    // and it does NOT take audio focus, so it won't fight RNTP) plays the
    // INCOMING track rising while the outgoing ExoPlayer track ramps down.
    // Android's mixer sums the two — that's the overlap.
    //
    // ## Why the schedule lives in Kotlin
    //
    // It used to be JS: a 1s setInterval noticed the boundary coming, a
    // setTimeout started the overlap, and a setTimeout poll did the handoff. RN
    // stops running JS timers the moment the activity pauses — screen off, or
    // any other app in front — so crossfade only ever happened while someone
    // was looking at this app. That is "it works sometimes, not most of the
    // time": most listening is done with the screen off.
    //
    // A Handler on the main looper keeps running for as long as the playback
    // foreground service keeps the process alive, and the main looper is also
    // the thread ExoPlayer insists on being touched from. So the whole cycle —
    // prepare, start at the boundary, hand off, cut — happens here, off
    // ExoPlayer's own position and queue, and JS only says how long the fade
    // is (setCrossfade). Every automatic transition gets it: album, playlist,
    // search, radio, background or foreground.
    //
    // ExoPlayer's class is not on our compile classpath (see MusicServiceRef),
    // so it is driven through the public Player interface by reflection. Any
    // lookup that fails reads as "no crossfade this time", never as a crash.
