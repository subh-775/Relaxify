Android environment bootstrap.
==============================
Chaquopy runs CPython inside the app process, so there is no "user home",
no Music folder, and no writable CWD in the usual sense. Kotlin hands us the
concrete app directories at startup (see BackendService.kt) and this module
turns them into the paths the rest of the backend expects.

Import this BEFORE anything from components/ — it sets HOME, which several
components read via Path.home().
