"""
Spotify playlist/album fetch.
=============================
Reads a public Spotify playlist or album into {name, image, tracks:[{title,
artist}]} — no API key, by scraping the public embed page's __NEXT_DATA__ blob.

Pure fetch only: turning those (title, artist) pairs into playable JioSaavn/
SoundCloud tracks is the caller's job, because that needs the search service.
If Spotify changes the page shape this returns None, so the caller degrades to
"playlist not found" rather than breaking.

      artist   — at least one credited Spotify artist appears in the candidate

    `weak_artist`: the item's artist may be wrong, as a YouTube channel name
    is when a label ("T-Series") uploaded the song. Then a near-exact title
