YouTube for the Android app, backed by NewPipeExtractor.
========================================================
The mobile YouTube source does NOT go through yt-dlp. Since late 2025 YouTube
gates its stream URLs behind a JS signature + throttling challenge, and yt-dlp
needs an external JS runtime (Deno) to solve it — there is none on Android.
Three attempts to graft a JS engine into yt-dlp's provider framework all failed
on-device.

NewPipeExtractor (the engine behind the NewPipe app) does the deobfuscation
itself with a bundled Rhino, in pure Java. This module is the thin Python side:
it calls YouTubeNP.kt over Chaquopy and hands back plain dicts.

Everything is guarded — any failure returns empty, which leaves YouTube simply
unavailable (the state the app is already in) and never disturbs JioSaavn or
SoundCloud.
